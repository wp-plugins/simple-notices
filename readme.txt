== Description ==

A simple plugin that adds a notification system to your WordPress. Via custom post types, Simple Notices gives you a way to make announcements that are displayed site-wide at the top of your site.

Notices are displayed with fixed positioning, meaning that they will overlap the rest of your site's contents. Each notice includes a close button that allows the current user to hide the notice. If the user is logged in, the notice ID will be permanently stored in their user meta, and so will never shown again. If the user is not logged in, the ID of the notice will be stored in a cookie.

Five colors are included:

* Blue
* Red
* Orange
* Green
* Gray
